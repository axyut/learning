# Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is the process of building a compiler for a language using the language itself.

-   A technique that allows the language to be self-hosting, meaning that the language can be used to compile itself.
-   The first compiler for a language is typically written in another language, but once the language is capable of compiling itself, the original compiler can be discarded.
