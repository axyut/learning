logs
Apache creates log files for any errors it generates in the file /var/log/apache2/error.log.

It also creates access logs for its interactions with clients in the file /var/log/apache2/access.log.

Here’s a list of other essential directories:

/etc/apache2/apache2.conf – This is the main Apache configuration file and controls everything Apache does on your system. Changes here affect all the websites hosted on this machine.
/etc/apache2/ports.conf – The port configuration file. You can customize the ports Apache monitors using this file. By default, Port 80 is configured for http traffic.
/etc/apache2/sites-available – Storage for Apache virtual host files. A virtual host is a record of one of the websites hosted on the server.
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled – This directory holds websites that are ready to serve clients. The a2ensite command is used on a virtual host file in the sites-available directory to add sites to this location.
